# TSP population based algorithms
Genetic algorithm for Travelling Salesman Problem

Input data is taken from a text file
Exemplary file could look like this (First number is the size of the matrix):

6
0 20 30 31 28 40
30 0 10 14 20 44
40 20 0 10 22 50
41 24 20 0 14 42
38 30 32 24 0 28
50 54 60 52 38 0

Program allows the user to change mutation and crossover probabilities, sizes of the population and elite, as well as genetic operators.

## Implemented Genetic Operators

### Selection
- roulette wheel
- rank based
- tournament

### Crossover
- one cut point OX
- two cut points OX
- cycle crossover
- edge crossover

### Mutation
- swap
